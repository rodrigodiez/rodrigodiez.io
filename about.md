I consider myself a full stack developer. I can produce high quality, test driven solutions on all client, server, service, data and infrastructure layers.

I worked for startups and for +500.000 daily visits companies. I learned from skilled workmates and I also leaded teams of awesome developers. I even ran my own company, learning valuable lessons along the way.

I am of the opinion that...

- Software is just another value vector
- The more performant way of evolving products and teams is generally by making small, incremental, iterative improvements based on the retrospective analysis of data
- Software is more expensive to evolve and to fix than to code. Hence, for a business is cheaper adhere to MVPs and high quality software than fat releases of low quality components
