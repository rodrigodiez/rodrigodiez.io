Is the frequency and the quality of posts what makes a blog worthy. It's winning a civil war, not just having an army, what makes someone *dictator perpetus*. It is the business problems that a code base solves, the easy that it is to extend and fix, what makes it valuable.

Hence, I will not write about what this blog is going to be, because I don't know that yet.

My name is Rodrigo DÃ­ez Villamuera. I am an agile developer and this post is my <abbr title="Minimum viable product" class="initialism">MVP</abbr>
